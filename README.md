# G59-Visitor-Management-System

A comprehensive visitor management system with face recognition authentication and robust backend APIs.

##  Project Overview
This system streamlines visitor registration and management processes through digital check-in/check-out functionality, face recognition authentication, and comprehensive logging capabilities.

##  Technical Architecture & Workflows

### System Workflows
- **Visitor Registration Flow**: Digital visitor registration → Face capture → Database storage
- **Authentication Process**: Face recognition verification → Access control → Entry logging
- **Admin Management**: Visitor tracking → Report generation → System monitoring

### Backend API Development
- RESTful APIs for visitor management operations
- Face recognition integration endpoints
- Real-time notification services
- Data analytics and reporting APIs

## Face Recognition Authentication

### Step-by-Step Authentication Process:
1. Image Capture: Visitor's face is captured using camera integration
2. Preprocessing: Image enhancement and face detection algorithms
3. Feature Extraction: Converting facial features into digital signatures
4. Database Matching: Comparing against registered visitor database
5. Authentication Result: Grant/deny access based on match confidence
6. Audit Logging: Recording all authentication attempts with timestamps
